# Daily-Event-Planner

Our work lives can be hectic at times, with multiple meetings, tasks, and deadlines to meet. Remembering all of these events can be a struggle when our workload reaches critical mass! This repository houses a day planner for business hours that can help organize you work day and conquer your day-to-day with ease and efficiency.

## The Repository

Upon visiting the site, the user will see the title of the website and a short description of what the planner does, along with a display of today's date. Underneath are rows pertaining to each hour of the business day. The hour is displayed on the left, with a text box in the middle entering your events for each hour, as well as a save button on the right to save your text to persist through the day! Each hour is also color coded to follow you through the day and keep you on track. Green signifies future events, red for the current hour's tasks, and grey for what you have already accomplished.

A preview of the site can be seen here:

I relished this learning opportunity to take advantage of utilizing data from a datetime library and incorporate it using JavaScript and jQuery to give functionality. Additionally, briefly using some CSS to help with dynamically highlight the time.
